# notint - ChatGPT Yellow Tint Remover

> A web tool to easily remove the unwanted yellow tint frequently found in images generated by ChatGPT. Processing is done entirely locally in the user's browser for privacy, requiring no image uploads.

This is a single-page static web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select or drag-and-drop an image file (supports formats like JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, HEIC). The application then processes the image client-side to reduce the yellow color cast. Users can compare the original and processed images side-by-side before downloading the corrected version. The primary focus is on user privacy and ease of use for a specific image artifact correction task.
