# notint: Fix Yellow Tint in ChatGPT Images

> Easily remove the unwanted yellow tint from images generated by ChatGPT (specifically the gpt-image-1 model variant). This tool processes images entirely locally in your web browser, ensuring privacy as no images are ever uploaded to a server.

## How to Use

1.  **Provide an Image:**
    - Drag and drop your image file (JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, HEIC) onto the designated "drop area" on the page.
    - Alternatively, click the "click to select file" button to browse and choose an image from your device.
2.  **Automatic Processing:**
    - Once an image is selected, the tool automatically starts processing it locally to reduce the yellow tint. A "processing..." indicator will appear.
3.  **View Results:**
    - After processing, the original image and the processed (tint-removed) image are displayed side-by-side for comparison.
4.  **Download:**
    - Click the "download processed image" button below the processed image preview to save the corrected version to your device (default filename: `notint.png`).
